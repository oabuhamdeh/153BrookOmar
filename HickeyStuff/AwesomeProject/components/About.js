            <Text style={styles.paragraphText}> {"\n"}This app is designed for us ADHD folk, who can't get through everyday life without a myriad of alarms
            on our phones. The idea for this app is that a user can have a full "schedule" of alarms in their phoneâ€”so, if they want an alarm to go off once
            every other week, we'd be able to make that happen. You can check which alarms are set to go off that day, and maybe we could even get to a place
            where the app will take note of which things you often set alarms for, and start suggesting certain alarms at certain times for you. We hope that
            this app will help people schedule things into their days and weeks in a way that will allow them to function more successfully in everyday life.
