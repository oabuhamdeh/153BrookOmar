ADHD ALARM APP
This alarm app, created by Brooke and Omar, is designed for a user to be able to schedule alarms into their phone with ease, so that someone who uses alarms throughout their daily life to remind them of tasks as they come up, is able to use this app to organize their tasks through the creation of alarms.

FEATURES:
This app has an original "alarms" button, which takes care of some of the preliminary app requirements in CA01; an "about" page, which informs the user about the app and its creators; an "official alarms" page, which allows the user to actually set alarms; and a "calendar" page (WIP), which allows the user to view their alarms in calendar form.
